# Gujarati Language Character Dataset

Akshar is a dataset containing 3400 images of Gujarati language characters. Each folder in the dataset contains 100 images of a letter out of 34 characters. This dataset is relatively smaller in size than other datasets. It is intended for faster training of characters on any Neural Network model. The dataset is tested on Google's Inception-V3 using transfer learning with training accuracy 82% and test accuracy 70.1%. 'Akshar' dataset is expected to be useful for testing accuracy of various deep learning models. Gujarati alphabets are little more complex in shape than English language. Thus, they are more challenging for testing accuracy of models. Dataset is free for anyone to use and improve by adding more font styles, complex letter orientations etc.
